## Description
> *I chose **KISMET** not just for it's meaning but also as a meaningful shorthand to my name **KRISTEN SM***
> 
[Kismet-INC.github.io](https://kismet-inc.github.io/index.html) is a website to display my body of work in a clean professional manner. I was based on a Bootstrap template in order to be launched and ready to view in a timely manner post graduation. The HTML, and CSS in this website was generated by the code in my repository [Kismet-INC/portfolio-dev](https://github.com/KISMET-INC/portfolio-dev) which stores and manages the backend technologies that generated these files.
