          <h2>Instructions:</h2>

          <p>Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Rajesh and Howard are in the queue for a "Double Cola" drink  vending machine; there are no other people in the queue. The first one in the queue (Sheldon) buys a can, drinks it and doubles! The resulting two Sheldons go to the end of the queue. Then the next in the queue (Leonard) buys a can, drinks it and gets to the end of the queue as two Leonards, and so on.</p>
          <p>For example, Penny drinks the third can of cola and the queue will look like this:</p>

          <div class="codeWindow"> Rajesh, Howard, Sheldon, Sheldon, Leonard, Leonard, Penny, Penny </div>

          <h2>Input:</h2>
          <p>The input data consist of an array which contains at least 1 name, and single integer n which may go as high as the biggest number your language of choice supports (if there's such limit, of course).</p>
            
          <h2>Output / Examples:</h2>
          <p>Return the single line â€” the name of the person who drinks the n-th can of cola. The cans are numbered starting from 1.</p>
          
          <div class = "codeWindow"> 
            <p>whoIsNext(["Sheldon", "Leonard", "Penny", "Rajesh", "Howard"], 1) == "Sheldon"</p>
            <p>whoIsNext(["Sheldon", "Leonard", "Penny", "Rajesh", "Howard"], 52) == "Penny"</p>
            <p>whoIsNext(["Sheldon", "Leonard", "Penny", "Rajesh", "Howard"], 7230702951) == "Leonard"</p>
