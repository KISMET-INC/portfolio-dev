          <ul>
            <p> I went with a template so that I could get something nice to showcase my work as a <b>Full Stack Web Developer</b> up and running immediately after graduation and not having to worry about designing and building out my own flashy sections and animations before the rest of my work can be seen. I am still very pleased with the result of my original portfolio and I may continue with it in the future but there was a reason I didn't jump on building this out fresh after graduation.</p>

          <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Used <b>Javascript</b> and <b>JQuery</b> to iplement flashy animations and create the appearance of an SPA which adds smooth and visually pleasent transitions through the website.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Utilized the <b>Bootstrap5</b> to implement information modals adding a classy modern feel ot the UX</li>
